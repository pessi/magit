magit (0.7-1) unstable; urgency=low

  * Tagging, on 't' and 'T'.

  * Stashing, on 'z' and 'Z'.

  * Wazzup, on 'w'.  Wazzup gives you an overview over how other
    branches relate to the current one.

  * There is more control over pushing.  'P' now takes a prefix argument
    and pushing a branch without a default remote will ask for one.

  * Logs have changed a bit: 'l' shows the traditional brief log, and
    'L' shows a more verbose log.  Use the prefix arg to specify the
    range of the log.

  * M-x magit-status doesn't prompt anymore for a directory when invoked
    from within a Git repository.  Use C-u to force a prompt.

  * When you have nothing staged, 'c' will now explicitly ask whether to
    commit everything instead of just going ahead and do it.  This can
    be customized.

  * The digit keys '1', '2', '3', and '4' now show sections on the
    respective level and hide everything below.  With Meta, they work on
    all sections; without, they work only on sections that are a parent
    or child of the current section.

  * Typing '+' and '-' will change the size of hunks, via the "-U"
    option to git diff.  '0' resets hunks to their default size.

  * Typing 'k' on the "Untracked files" section title will offer to
    delete all untracked files.

  * Magit understands a bit of git-svn: the status buffer shows unpushed
    and unpulled commits, 'N r' runs git svn rebase, and 'N c' runs git
    svn dcommit.

  * Magit now also works when the direcory is accessed via tramp.

  * M-x magit-status can also create new repositories when given a
    directory that is not a Git repository.

  * Magit works better with oldish Gits that don't understand "--graph",
    for example.

  * The name of the Git program and common options for it can be
    customized.

  * Sections can be shown and hidden.

  * Staging, unstaging, applying, reverting and discarding changes can now
